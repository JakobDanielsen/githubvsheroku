        <h1 class="display-4"> What are the differences?</h1>
        <p class="lead">The main differences between hosting a website on github versus heroku is that github only allows static contents wich is easier to make but makes all code public and very transparent instead of using responses and requests. In other words you can not host a page on github that uses express.js or other similar frameworks.
            Heroku lets you host more freely and its possible to use websites with requests and responses like node express.js.  </p>

        <p class="fs-4">Heroku and Github are both very powerful tools that can be used for online hosting, however you should chose your alternative based on what you want to upload.
            If you just want a little project uploaded as a folder without using express.js Github is the best choice. If you want a more server-like website that uses requests, responses and hidden files you should pick Heroku.
